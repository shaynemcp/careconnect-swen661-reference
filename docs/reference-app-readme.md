About
CareConnect lowers the daily cognitive load for people who need help remembering, while giving caregivers clear visibility and control over medications and appointments. The patient experience is built around recognition over recall: a persistent orientation bar (who you are, the day and time, where you are), one primary task per screen, always-visible and timestamped medication status, and an undo path on every action. The caregiver experience is a denser dashboard for managing schedules and monitoring adherence.
The two experiences share a single accessible component library and design-token system, so behavior and styling stay consistent across the app.
Who it's for
Care recipients (patients) with short-term memory loss — calm, low-clutter screens, large targets, plain language, and no time pressure.
Caregivers — an information-rich dashboard with adherence tracking, alerts, and full schedule management.
Key features
Patient
Today home with a prominent "Next thing to do" card and the day's remaining items.
Medications with pill images, plain-language doses, always-visible status, and a 10-second undo on every dose.
Appointments in chronological order with full-word dates, locations, and "who is taking me."
A persistent "Call my caregiver" action on every patient screen.
Caregiver
Dashboard with adherence summary, an alerts region for missed/overdue items, and a recent-activity timeline.
Manage medications and manage appointments with accessible create/edit forms, inline validation, and delete confirmation.
All caregiver edits propagate to the patient screens.
Shared
Public landing page with an accessible, scoped AI assistant (explains the app and guides sign in/up; never gives medical advice).
Installable PWA with offline access to the day's schedule.
Accessibility
CareConnect is designed and verified against 21 WCAG 2.1 A/AA success criteria, with full conformance mapping in `ACCESSIBILITY.md`.
Highlights: 4.5:1 text contrast, full keyboard operability, visible focus indicators, semantic landmarks, ARIA live regions (`role="status"` / `role="alert"`), 44x44px minimum targets, 320px reflow with no horizontal scroll, and `prefers-reduced-motion` support.
Tech stack
Layer Technology
Framework React 18 + Vite
Language TypeScript (strict)
Styling Tailwind CSS with accessibility-first design tokens
Routing React Router (protected routes)
State / persistence React Context + `localStorage` (mock data)
AI assistant Anthropic API via a serverless/edge function

Getting started
Prerequisites
Node.js 18+ and npm
A modern browser
(Optional) An Anthropic API key for the landing-page assistant
Get the code
Clone with Git (HTTPS):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aliminagar/careconnect-swen661.git
cd careconnect-swen661
```

Clone with SSH:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:aliminagar/careconnect-swen661.git
cd careconnect-swen661
```

Clone with GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh repo clone aliminagar/careconnect-swen661
cd careconnect-swen661
```

Download without Git: on the GitHub repo page, click Code → Download ZIP, then unzip and open the folder.
Install and configure

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env     # then fill in your values
```

`.env` variables:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url            # only if using Supabase
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key  # public/anon key (protected by RLS)
# Server-side only — NEVER prefix with VITE_:
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key           # used by api/assistant.ts
```

> The app runs on mock `localStorage` data without any backend keys. If the Anthropic key is absent, the assistant falls back to a scripted guided helper.
> Run

```bash
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
```

Publish your own copy to GitHub
If the project isn't on GitHub yet:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: CareConnect"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/aliminagar/careconnect-swen661.git
git push -u origin main
```

> Confirm `.env` is listed in `.gitignore` before your first push so secrets never reach the repo.

Testing
Unit & component: Jest + React Testing Library (`npm test`), targeting 60–75% coverage per the course milestones.
End-to-end: Playwright specs for core flows (sign in → take medication → caregiver sees adherence).
Accessibility: axe DevTools, Lighthouse (target 95+ accessibility), and manual screen-reader testing (NVDA / VoiceOver) plus keyboard-only navigation.
Deployment

```bash
npm run build       # outputs to /dist
```

Deploy `/dist` to Netlify or Vercel. Configure the assistant's serverless function and set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the host's environment settings (never client-side).
Roadmap
Real backend with Supabase + Row Level Security
Multi-patient support for caregivers
Push-notification medication reminders
Localization / bilingual support
