## 1. Project overview

**Application name:** CareConnect

**Description.** CareConnect is a cross-platform (mobile, web, and desktop)
care-coordination app built for patients with ADHD and the caregivers who support them. It
turns medications, appointments, and multi-step daily tasks into short, plain-language
steps with visible progress and time-aware reminders, so the patient doesn't have to rely
on memory or executive-function effort to stay on track, while caregivers get a clear,
low-noise view of what's been done and what needs their attention. Built to WCAG 2.2 Level
AA with an explicit ADHD-friendly, cognitive-load-reduction design lean.

**Target audience.** Patients with ADHD, and their caregivers (family members or other
support people who help manage medications, appointments, and daily tasks).

**Primary problem this app solves.** ADHD commonly involves difficulty with time
perception ("time blindness"), task initiation, working memory, and follow-through — which
shows up as missed medications, missed or late appointments, and half-finished multi-step
tasks. Caregivers, in turn, struggle to know what's actually been done versus forgotten
without constant check-ins. CareConnect reduces that load by breaking tasks into short
visible steps, handling the remembering, and giving caregivers visibility without requiring
the patient to self-report constantly.

## 2. Assigned constraints

**1. User group:** patients with ADHD, and their caregivers.

**2. Platform coverage:** web, mobile (Android and iOS), and desktop (Windows and macOS).

**3. Accessibility:** WCAG 2.2 Level AA, plus the team's ADHD-friendly /
cognitive-load-reduction design lean from the SWEN 661 kickoff meeting — simple uncluttered
screens, no unnecessary animation or time limits, tasks broken into short numbered steps
with visible progress, plain-language instructions, no reliance on remembering information
from a previous screen, save-and-resume, large labeled buttons, clear error messages, full
keyboard and screen-reader support, no color-only signaling, adequate contrast.

**4. Technical stack:** the course-wide toolchain — Flutter and React Native for mobile,
Electron for desktop, React + Vite for web.

## 3. Key features

> **Sync note.** This list mirrors the team's agreed feature backlog — **12 features**,
> within the 8–12 that Assignment 1 Part 3 requires. Acceptance criteria are included
> because the rubric's *Highly Proficient* band asks for "detailed feature descriptions
> with acceptance criteria." **Verify this section also exists in the SharePoint
> document**, which is the graded artifact.

Prioritized **Must-Have** (required for a passing product), **Should-Have** (planned;
first to be descoped under schedule pressure), and **Nice-to-Have** (built only if
ahead of schedule).

### Must-Have

**1. Today Home Screen**
A persistent orientation bar (who you are, the day and time, where you are in the app)
above a single prominent "Next thing to do" card.
*Acceptance:* exactly one primary action per screen; remaining items are visually
subordinate; when nothing is due, a calm confirmed-empty state appears rather than a
blank region; the orientation bar appears on every patient screen and is exposed as a
landmark.

**2. Medications Screen**
Pill images, plain-language dose descriptions, always-visible status, and a 10-second
undo on every action.
*Acceptance:* status (taken / due / overdue) and time taken are visible in the list
without opening a detail view; status is carried by text and icon, never color alone;
changes announce through an ARIA live region; every dose action offers a 10-second undo
that is keyboard reachable and announced.

**3. Appointments Screen**
Chronological appointments with full-word dates, location, and who is accompanying the
patient.
*Acceptance:* no bare numeric dates such as "8/25" anywhere; dates render as "Tuesday,
August 25"; ordering is strictly chronological; each entry states its location and who,
if anyone, is taking the patient.

**4. Persistent "Call My Caregiver" Action**
A help action in the same relative position on every screen.
*Acceptance:* reachable within one interaction from every patient screen; consistent
location across all screens, satisfying **SC 3.2.6 Consistent Help**; target at least
44×44px.

**5. Reminders**
Medication and appointment notifications with user control over frequency and snooze.
*Acceptance:* reminders can be disabled entirely; lead time configurable; snooze options
offered and configurable; a hard cap on repeats prevents nagging; no reminder forfeits
an action when it expires.

**6. Installable PWA with Offline Access**
*Acceptance:* passes installability checks; the current day's medications and
appointments render with the network disconnected; the UI states plainly when data was
last synced.

**7. Accessibility Engineered Into Every Screen**
WCAG 2.2 Level AA as a build requirement, not a later audit.
*Acceptance:* 4.5:1 minimum text contrast (3:1 for large text and UI components);
complete keyboard operability with no traps; focus visible against every background;
ARIA live regions for status changes; 44×44px targets, exceeding the 24×24px of
**SC 2.5.8**; 320px reflow with no horizontal scrolling; `prefers-reduced-motion`
honored; color never the sole carrier of meaning; zero critical/serious axe violations;
Lighthouse accessibility ≥ 95.

### Should-Have

**8. Caregiver Dashboard**
Adherence summary, an alerts region for missed or overdue items, and a recent-activity
timeline.
*Acceptance:* alerts announce through an ARIA alert region; distinguishes completed,
missed, and upcoming without requiring the patient to self-report; the patient can see
exactly what the caregiver can see.

**9. Manage Medications (Caregiver)**
*Acceptance:* every input has a programmatically associated visible label; errors
identify the field, state what is wrong, and state how to fix it; incomplete work saves
and resumes; deletion requires explicit confirmation; edits propagate to patient screens.

**10. Manage Appointments (Caregiver)**
*Acceptance:* identical form, validation, save-and-resume, and delete-confirmation
behavior as feature 9 — consistency between the two screens is itself a requirement.

**11. Role Chooser with Low-Cognitive-Load Sign-In**
A post-sign-in choice between Care Recipient and Caregiver, persisted for later sessions.
*Acceptance:* the role choice persists and is not asked again; sign-in imposes no
cognitive function test such as a memory puzzle, satisfying **SC 3.3.8 Accessible
Authentication**; no already-provided information is requested twice in the same
process, satisfying **SC 3.3.7 Redundant Entry**.

### Nice-to-Have

**12. Shared Accessible Component Library and Design-Token System**
A single component library and token set backing the web, mobile, and desktop builds.
*Acceptance:* colors defined once as tokens with recorded contrast ratios, verified
automatically (`npm run check:contrast`); components ship keyboard- and
screen-reader-ready so accessibility work is done once rather than per platform;
behavior and styling stay consistent across all three platforms.

## 4. Platform deployment plan

CareConnect ships to three platform families using the course-wide toolchain. Each row
below is a graded deliverable, so the plan is written as a build-and-verify commitment
rather than a statement of intent.

| Platform | Technology | Target | Build output | Assignment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Mobile** | Flutter | Android and iOS | `.apk` (Android), simulator build (iOS) | 3–4, 6 |
| **Mobile** | React Native + Expo | Android and iOS | Expo dev build / `.apk` | 5–6 |
| **Desktop** | Electron + electron-builder | **Windows and macOS** | `.exe` (NSIS), `.dmg` | 7–9 |
| **Web** | React + Vite | Responsive PWA, installable | Static bundle | 10–11 |

### Desktop: targeting two operating systems

Assignment 1's template asks teams to choose **one** desktop OS. This team's assigned
platform-coverage constraint specifies **both Windows and macOS**, so the proposal targets
both. Where the template and the assigned constraint conflict, the assigned constraint
governs; this is flagged for instructor confirmation in §7.

The team's hardware makes this feasible rather than aspirational. Electron produces
platform-specific installers that must be built and screen-reader tested on the target OS:

| OS | Built and tested by | Screen reader |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows 10 | Abel Tabor, Quinton Coleman | NVDA |
| macOS | Shayne McPherson | VoiceOver |

Two members on Windows and one on macOS means both targets are covered natively, with no
virtual machines and no untested build. The cost is roughly double the desktop QA surface,
which is recorded as the team's leading schedule risk in §6.

**Linux is out of scope** and remains a possible future iteration.

### Mobile: a hardware constraint worth stating plainly

Android builds can be produced by any team member on any operating system via Android
Studio. **iOS builds cannot.** Xcode runs only on macOS, so every iOS build, simulator
run, and VoiceOver-on-iOS accessibility pass depends on the one macOS machine on this team.

Consequences the team accepts:

- iOS work is scheduled around a single member's availability and is not parallelizable.
- Android is the primary mobile verification target for day-to-day development; iOS is
  verified at each assignment boundary rather than continuously.
- If that machine is unavailable during Assignments 4–6, iOS evidence is the deliverable
  at risk, and the mitigation is to front-load iOS screenshots and screen-reader captures
  early in each of those weeks.

### Web: the primary accessibility proving ground

The React + Vite build is a responsive, installable PWA with offline access to the current
day's medications and appointments, per Must-Have feature 6. It is also where automated
accessibility verification runs in CI on every pull request — axe-core across WCAG 2.2 AA
rules, plus a Lighthouse accessibility budget — because the web build is the only target
those tools drive directly. Conformance findings there propagate to the shared component
library, so a fix made once benefits all three platforms.

Deployment for Assignment 11 targets a static host (Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages).

### Distribution scope

**App store distribution is explicitly out of scope.** Publishing to the Apple App Store
and Google Play requires paid developer enrollment and review cycles measured in weeks,
neither of which fits a twelve-week course. Deliverables are therefore locally built
installers and application bundles, evidenced by build logs, screenshots, and recorded
walkthroughs, with the web build deployed to a public URL.

### Shared foundation

All three platform families draw on one npm workspaces monorepo — `apps/web`,
`apps/desktop`, `apps/mobile`, and shared `packages/{ui,design-tokens,mock-data}`. Design
tokens are defined once with recorded contrast ratios and verified automatically in CI, so
a WCAG 2.2 AA colour decision is made once and inherited everywhere rather than
re-litigated per platform.

---

## 5. Success criteria

**How success is defined.** A working build that implements every Must-Have feature across
all three platforms with WCAG 2.2 AA conformance verified via axe, WAVE, and Lighthouse
(accessibility score 95+), passes manual keyboard-only and screen-reader
(NVDA / VoiceOver / TalkBack) testing, and is validated with mock user sessions that include
at least one participant simulating the ADHD patient persona. Automated test coverage of
60–75%. Instructor approves the proposal by end of Week 1 with no major rework requested at
the Week 2 refinement checkpoint.

**Metrics and user feedback.**

| Type | Measure |
| --- | --- |
| Automated | Jest / React Testing Library coverage percentage (target 60–75%) |
| Automated | Lighthouse accessibility score (target 95+) |
| Automated | axe DevTools violation count (target zero) |
| Manual | Full keyboard-only walkthrough on every screen |
| Manual | NVDA / VoiceOver / TalkBack screen-reader pass on every screen |
| Manual | Usability feedback from mock user sessions role-playing the ADHD patient and caregiver personas |

## 6. Initial risks

**Challenges.**

| # | Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | **Dual desktop OS target (Windows + macOS)** roughly doubles the desktop build and QA surface compared to a single-OS team within the same timeline. | Team OS mix covers both natively (two Windows, one macOS). Isolate platform-specific code behind a thin adapter. Confirm the dual target with the instructor at approval. |
| R2 | **Simultaneous ramp-up on Flutter, React Native, and Electron** risks environment-setup delays. | Close the toolchain gaps in Weeks 1–2 rather than at the assignment that needs them — see [environment-setup.md](environment-setup.md). Freeze the design before Assignment 3 so the second mobile build is a port, not a redesign. |
| R3 | **Designing around an ADHD user group risks oversimplifying real needs** if not grounded in real input. | Base decisions on established guidance (WCAG 2.2 AA and the team's ADHD-friendly design lean) and validate directly with mock user sessions using a persona that reflects real ADHD experience, not assumptions. |
